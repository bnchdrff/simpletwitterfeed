Simple Twitter Feed
===================

Forked from https://drupal.org/sandbox/bobbydank/2045997

Modified to use a separate php library for accessing Twitter API using a bearer token.

## Summary

This is a simple module that uses Twitter's API 1.1 to get an unordered
HTML list of latest tweets based on your Twitter username. The module
creates a block that can be put in any region. The block's configuration
holds all the fields needed to fetch the feed. Options are currently limited
for 1.0 release but more features could follow if the requests are there.
Use the comments below to request features.

## Requirements

Drupal 7.x

## Installation

Install libs:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

Enabling module will create the block.

Once created, you will need to create a Twitter Application to obtain
OAuth codes that are compliant with Twitter's 1.1 API.

## Configuration

Supply Twitter credentials in the block configuration. The Bearer Token is
generated by Twitter and saved as a Drupal variable when you submit the
block configuration form.

## Customization

The module returns an unordered, HTML list of the tweets. Any styling can
be handled in your theme's css files.
